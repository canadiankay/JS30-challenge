# Welcome to my version of JavaScript 30 practice projects, a free course created by Wes Bos to practice vanilla JS skills.

## To do list
- complete a project a day
- create a website that hosts all of these projects (e.g. [like this](https://kellychi22.github.io/JavaScript30/) )~
- update and customize each challenge
  - Day 1: add duff or nasheed sounds and change background

### Day 1: JS Drum Kit
- `keydown` event --> listen for pressed keys
- HTML `data-*` Global Attribute --> to give a custom attribute
- `HTMLMediaElement.play()` method --> to play an audio/video element
- `HTMLMediaElement.currentTime` property --> gives us the current time
- `transitionend` DOM event --> listen for the end of a transition event
